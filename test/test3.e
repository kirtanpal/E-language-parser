     # The following code is for loop
     # first we give the initial value of a to 1
     # then after : the condition ((a-10)<=0) to be true,
     # which is true is the expression is non positive
     # then after : incrementation assignment
     # to increment the variable a every time we run loop
     # and in last we have our block where we are
     # first declaring an integer p and assigning it value 10
     # and then we are printing the table of 2
